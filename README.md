# 📊 IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition & Retention

## 📌 Project Overview
**"Why are our best people leaving?"**

This project performs a descriptive analysis on a dataset of 1,470 employees to investigate the root causes of attrition (employee turnover). By analyzing demographics, job satisfaction, and income data, I identified key risk factors and calculated the potential financial impact of losing talent.

**Key Business Questions Answered:**
1. What are the strongest indicators of attrition?
2. Which departments are "bleeding" talent?
3. What is the estimated financial loss due to turnover?
